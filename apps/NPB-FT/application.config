# Vespa configuration file for applications. 
# The [Application] and [Execution] sections are mandatory when running experiments. 
# The [Consolidate] section is only validated and read when using vespa-consolidate.

[Application]
# Dir for executable
app.home=/home/giacomo2/shared/NPB-FT

# Name for executable
app.executable=run-ft.sh

# Default application arguments (overridden by experiment definition)
app.args=B 8

[Execution]
# Execute with an execution manager: { Torque | <empty> }
exec.manager=Torque

# Timeout (assume failure)
exec.walltime=60:00

# if need for other output, use (space-separated) filename(s), leave blank otherwise
exec.otheroutput=

# if need for a single other output file, rename to this name, leave blank otherwise
exec.outputrename=

[Consolidate]
# Directory from which experiments are read when consolidating
# By default this parameter is used. This can be overridden when calling 
# vespa-consolidate program. See example below.
consolidate.default=/tmp/vespa/tests/consolidate/NPB-FT

# Other consolidation inputs. In this example, the keyword used is "workshop".
consolidate.workshop=/tmp/vespa/tests/consolidate/NPB-FT-workshop
